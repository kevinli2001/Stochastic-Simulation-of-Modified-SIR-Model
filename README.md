# Stochastic-Simulation-of-Modified-SIR-Model
This is the first project of the computer simulation class.

The year 2020 will forever be remembered as a time when the world was engulfed by the deadly
Covid-19 pandemic, causing a significant loss of life and devastating impacts on society. As a
result, the importance of investigating epidemic models has become more pronounced than ever
before. While the traditional SIR model has been extensively utilized for simulating the
dynamics of susceptible, infected, and recovered populations, it fails to account for the impact of
artificial control measures such as quarantine and vaccination.

Given that humans have the ability to intervene and change the course of an epidemic through
the implementation of anti-epidemic policies, it is crucial to incorporate these measures into
epidemic models. In light of this, we embark on a project to delve into the effects of quarantine
within the SIR model, with the aim of simulating different scenarios under varying quarantine
rates to determine the most effective intervention rate.

Through this project, we seek to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of quarantine on the
dynamics of an epidemic, with a view to providing evidence-based recommendations on the
optimal quarantine rate that can help to control and mitigate the spread of infectious diseases. By
taking a comprehensive approach to modeling epidemics, we hope to contribute to the
development of effective strategies for managing infectious diseases and safeguarding public
health.
